Often considered the\\nbest player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has\\nwon a record seven Ballon d'Or awards,[note 2] a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020\\nwas named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire\\nprofessional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 35 trophies, including ten La Liga\\ntitles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues. A prolific goalscorer and\\ncreative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), a La Liga and European\\nleague season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8), and most\\nassists in La Liga (192), a La Liga season (21) and the Copa América (17). He also holds the record\\nfor most international goals by a South American male (86). Messi has scored over 750 senior\\ncareer goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club.\\nBorn and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at the age of 13, for\\nwhom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an\\nintegral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in\\n2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi\\nwon his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive\\nBallons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times and in a row.[10] During the\\n2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season,\\nwhile establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi\\nfinished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before\\nregaining his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga\\nand leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in\\n2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he won a record sixth Ballon\\nd'Or. Out of contract, he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021.\\nAn Argentine international, Messi holds the national record for appearances and is also the country's\\nall-time leading goalscorer. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship,\\nfinishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at\\nthe 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons\\nwith his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut\\nin August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup in\\n2006, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the\\ntournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals:\\nthe 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copa América,\\nwinning the Golden Ball in the 2015 edition. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he\\nreversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place\\nfinish at the 2019 Copa América, and won the 2021 Copa América, while winning the Golden Ball\\nand Golden Boot award for the latter. This achievement would see him receive a record seventh\\nBallon d'Or in 2021.\\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was\\nthe world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked\\nthe world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022.[11] Messi was among Time's 100 most\\ninfluential people in the world in 2011 and 2012. In February 2020, he was awarded the Laureus\\nWorld Sportsman of the Year, thus becoming the first footballer and the first team sport athlete to win\\nthe award. Later that year, Messi became the second footballer (and second team-sport athlete) to\\nsurpass $1 billion in career earnings.\\n\""
