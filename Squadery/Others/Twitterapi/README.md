### Sentiment Analysis Using TwitterAPI
I have done the sentiment analysis of the tweets using the latest tweets done by a person.

This notebook contains the code to get the insight on how many of the tweets done by any twitter users are Positive, Negative or Neutral.

Create a seperate file called config.ini containing the following information and add the path in the notebook to connect to the twitterapi. 

```bash
[twitter]
API_KEY = <>
API_KEY_SECRET = <>
Bearer_Token = <>
Access_Token = <>
Access_Token_Secret = <>
```
