## Structured Query Language (SQL)

SQL is a standard programming language for relational database management and data manipulation. It is used to query, insert, update and modify data.

How we write syntax will depend on what DBMS we are using, i.e. for every other DBMS, syntax changes.

Here, I have used MySQL as a Database Management System (DBMS) and performed all the queries in  MySQL Workbench.

The topics I covered for writing queries are listed below.

Creating database and tables (CREATE) <br>
Retrieving data (SELECT)<br>
Inserting data (INSERT)<br>
Updating data (UPDATE)<br>
Altering table (ALTER)<br>
Deleting data/table/database (TRUNCATE, DROP, DELETE)<br>
Constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, DEFAULT, LIMIT)<br>
SQL clauses (WHERE, DISTINCT, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING)<br>
SQL Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, FIRST, LAST)<br>
SQL Conditions (AND, OR, LIKE, NOT, IS NULL, BETWEEN)<br>
JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, CROSS, SELF)<br>
